# this is a cool thing
little fun project for cryptography and all that

works on (and made with) replit https://replit.com/@WellSilver/Email

## docs thing
!!! subject to change 111

v1

``send <usr> <style> <version>`` send request

usr: obv

style: html, markdown, text

version: duh int

``okay <code>`` response

- 1 continue 
- 2 invalid user 
- 3 invalid args 
- 4 error

``what <size>`` follow up

size - size of bytes in email, must be int

another ``okay`` response but only 2 potential errors (1,4)

``<messsage>`` duh
## maybe

to verify emails use domains?

im sure domains would stay the same just how.

maybe sender will re-connect but using the domain?

btw instead of domain@user it will be like domain:user for the difference
